  abstract = {Description logics (DLs) have a long tradition in computer science and knowledge representation, being designed so that domain knowledge can be described and so that computers can reason about this knowledge. DLs have recently gained increased importance since they form the logical basis of widely used ontology languages, in particular the web ontology language OWL. Written by four renowned experts, this is the first textbook on description logics. It is suitable for self-study by graduates and as the basis for a university course. Starting from a basic DL, the book introduces the reader to their syntax, semantics, reasoning problems and model theory and discusses the computational complexity of these reasoning problems and algorithms to solve them. It then explores a variety of reasoning techniques, knowledge-based applications and tools and it describes the relationship between DLs and OWL.},

  abstract = {Ontology conceptualization is an ontology development task that consists in generating a preliminary model based on the requirements that the ontology should represent. This activity is often carried out by generating the models as diagrams in a blackboard, paper or digital tools. The generated models drive the ontology implementation activity, where the model is formalized and completed using an implementation language. Normally, the ontology conceptualization output serves as guidance for the ontology implementation; however, ontology implementation is usually done from scratch using ontology editors. The goal of this work is to consider ontology conceptualizations as first-order artifacts in ontology development in order to boost the ontology implementation activity. For doing so we present Chowlk, a framework to transform digital machine-processable ontology conceptualization diagrams into OWL. Domain experts and ontologists benefit from this approach in several ways: 1) reduce time generating the first versions of the OWL file that can be invested on 2) focusing on the conceptualization diagrams that can be used both for 3) improving communication between ontology users and developers and 4) be reused during the ontology documentation stage.},

However, many of these ontologies are still difficult to find, access and understand by researchers due to a lack of documentation, URI resolving issues, versioning problems, etc. In this chapter we describe guidelines and best practices for creating accessible, understandable and reusable ontologies on the Web, using standard practices and pointing to existing tools and frameworks developed by the Semantic Web community. We illustrate our guidelines with concrete examples, in order to help researchers implement these practices in their future vocabularies.},

We explain how knowledge can be represented and extracted using a combination of deductive and inductive techniques. We conclude with high-level future research directions for knowledge graphs.},

  abstract = {An Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG) is a major asset for companies as it supports several downstream tasks, e.g., business vocabulary sharing, search, or question answering. The bootstrap of an EKG can rely on internal business data sets or open knowledge graphs. In this paper, we consider the latter approach. We propose to build the nucleus of an EKG class hierarchy by mapping internal business terms to Wikidata entities and performing an expansion along the ontology hierarchy. This nucleus thus contains additional business terms that will, in turn, support further knowledge extraction approaches from texts or tables. However, since Wikidata contains numerous classes, there is a need to limit this expansion by pruning classes unrelated to the business topics of interest. To this aim, we propose to rely on the distance between node embeddings and node degree. We show that considering the embedding of a class as the centroid of the embeddings of its instances improves pruning and that node degree is a necessary feature to consider.},

  abstract = {Reusing ontologies for new purposes, or adapting them to new use-cases, is frequently difficult. In our experiences, we have found this to be the case for several reasons: (i) differing representational granularity in ontologies and in use-cases, (ii)~lacking conceptual clarity in potentially reusable ontologies, (iii) lack and difficulty of adherence to good modeling principles, and (iv) a lack of reuse emphasis and process support available in ontology engineering tooling. In order to address these concerns, we have developed the Modular Ontology Modeling (MOMo) methodology, and its supporting tooling infrastructure, CoModIDE (the Comprehensive Modular Ontology IDE – “commodity”). MOMo builds on the established eXtreme Design methodology, and like it emphasizes modular development and design pattern reuse; but crucially adds the extensive use of graphical schema diagrams, and tooling that support them, as vehicles for knowledge elicitation from experts. In this paper, we present the MOMo workflow in detail, and describe several useful resources for executing it. In particular, we provide a thorough and rigorous evaluation of CoModIDE in its role of supporting the MOMo methodology’s graphical modeling paradigm. We find that CoModIDE significantly improves approachability of such a paradigm, and that it displays a high usability.},
