# FastKG-Course: A Fast.ai Approach to Learning Knowledge Graphs

![](images/logo.png)

## Introduction

Welcome to FastKG-Course, an interactive course designed to make you proficient in Knowledge Graphs, Semantic Technologies, Ontology, and more. This project is affiliated with the [Laboratory for Assured AI Applications Development](https://la3d.github.io/nuggets/about) in the [Center for Research Computing](https://crc.nd.edu) at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu).

## Features

- Interactive Jupyter Notebooks
- Hands-on Tutorials
- Use of fast.ai and kglab libraries

## Getting Started
[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/LA3D/fastkg-course)

1. (Optional) Fork this repository
1. Open the project in [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)
1. The [devcontainer](https://containers.dev/) will automatically set up your environment
1. Start the Jupyter server and open the introductory notebook

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, it is highly recommended to complete the following Fast.ai courses:

- [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/)
- [Deep Learning for Coders with fastai & Pytorch](https://course.fast.ai/Resources/book.html)
- [Jupyter Notebook 101](https://github.com/fastai/course22/blob/master/01-jupyter-notebook-101.ipynb)

Additional requirements:

- Basic knowledge of Python
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts


## Usage

Navigate through the Jupyter notebooks in sequence for a curated educational path, or feel free to explore topics that interest you.

The [dev container](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) is fully configured with software and [KG and machine learning libraries](.devcontainer/requirements.txt) needed for this course.
