    "## A \"Fast\" start to Knowledge Graphs using Semantic Technologies\n",
    "This set of jupyter notebooks and codespace are meant to [`bootstrap`](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1195936) your understanding of Knowledge Engineering, Knowledge Graphs, Linked Data and how Generative AI can leverage these technologies to be more factual. We say a `Fast` start because we want to use the learning principles as espoused by the [fast.ai - fast.ai—Making neural nets uncool again](https://www.fast.ai/) and summarized in the blog [fast.ai - Providing a Good Education in Deep Learning](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2016-10-08-teaching-philosophy.html). Hopefully this will make Knowledge Engineering just as `uncool` as neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "Given that we are building on the Fast.ai approach, we will leverage some of their introductory materials for doing machine learning and working with AI. At a minimum, the readers should be familiar with:\n",

    "## Use of Generative AI for learning!\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that ChatGPT, Bing Chat, Bard, Claude v2 and other Generative AI Agents tuned for `Conversational AI` have a decent knowledge of the [\"Semantic Web Stack\"](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Specs.html) and are particularly good at using Python tools for the semantic web like [rdflib](https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). We highly recommend using these `copilots` for creating code blocks, debugging and solving problems. We will leverage these agents in later notebooks for assisting in \"ontology\" construction.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding of the `Semantic Web` Stack\n",
    "A vision for a `semantic web` was laid out by the \"father\" of the World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee and his co-authors [@berners-leeSemanticWeb2001] in the paper [\"The Semantic Web\"](https://lassila.org/publications/2001/SciAm.pdf) that involved **Software Agents**, **Shared Formal Concepts called Ontologies**, and [**Linked Data**](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html) to provide the structure for a world driven by *Assistive Agents*. To further this vision, the standards body for the Web, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created standards for exchanging semantic Knowledge Graphs called the [Resource Description Framework (RDF)](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/) and a method for specifying formal shared concepts called [Web Ontology Language (OWL)](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/). The publication, \"A data engineer's guide to semantic modeling\" [direct pdf download](https://zenodo.org/record/3898519/files/A%20data%20engineer%27s%20guide%20to%20semantic%20modelling.pdf?download=1) by Ilaria Maresi [@ilaria_maresi_2020_3898519] of [The Hyve](https://www.thehyve.nl/) provides a **very** accessible guide to \"semantic modeling\" and will be the *primary* reference going forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Knowledge Graphs\n",
    "A more technical reference on the topic of **Knowledge Graphs** is provided in the book [@kg-book]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools for constructing knowledge graphs\n",
    "[Derwen.ai](https://derwen.ai/) has created a Python Package called [kglab](https://derwen.ai/docs/kgl/) that \"provides a simple abstraction layer in Python for building knowledge graphs.\" The [kglab tutorial](https://derwen.ai/docs/kgl/tutorial/) is quite good at providing an introduction to the **semantic web** stack and have included [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/DerwenAI/kglab/) as a [git submodule](https://github.blog/2016-02-01-working-with-submodules/).\n",
